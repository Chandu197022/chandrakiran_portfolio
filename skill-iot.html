In practice, building IoT systems requires attention to hardware selection, signal conditioning, and robust firmware. For embedded nodes I commonly use ESP32 or Arduino-class MCUs; they provide Wi-Fi/BLE for connectivity and sufficient I/O for sensors.</p><p class="small">Sensor calibration and debouncing are crucial — raw sensor readings are noisy and must be filtered before decisions. Power budgeting matters in field deployments, especially when battery-operated. Edge logic (simple thresholds, state machines) saves bandwidth and reduces cloud costs.</p><p class="small">Connectivity protocols matter: MQTT is lightweight and ideal for telemetry, while HTTP/REST works for simple uploads. Security is often overlooked — secure provisioning and credential management should be baked into the firmware. OTA updates keep devices maintainable.</p><h2>Related Projects</h2><ul class="small"><li><a class="card-link" href="project-parking.html">Smart Parking System</a></li><li><a class="card-link" href="project-solar.html">Home Energy Monitor / Solar Data Logger</a></li></ul></div></main><footer class="footer">© 2025 Chandrakiran Rongali</footer></body></html>
